Yo momma is so fat, I took a picture of her last Christmas and it's still printing.

Yo momma is so fat that when she went to the beach a whale swam up and sang, "We are family, even though you're fatter than me."

Yo momma's so fat and old when God said, "Let there be light," he asked your mother to move out of the way.

Yo momma's so fat, that when she fell, no one was laughing but the ground was cracking up.
